#I started assignment assignment3 today (1/30).
vari1 = 13

puts vari1 + vari2
#since 13 and 9 are both integers I made vari1 as the integer 13 and vari2 the integer 9. Because they are integers I added them together by adding vari1+vari2

#I created 2 varibles; last_name for my last name and first_name for my first name.  I then inserted my variables into some beastie boy lyrics.

#So the answer is yes, Ampola and Kelly will be able to afford the monthly mortgage payment until Ampola's alcohol and weed bills get factored in.
#so I had to do a little research here because I was using the "^" symbol and I wasn't getting the figures correct.  So instead of using the '^' key I ended up using '**'.  The answer came out correctly so I'm assuming that's the way to do it.  If not please correct and I will do so accordingly.
